# peep-font
Traced bitmap font called peep

Traced using potrace and fontforge from this bitmap font:
http://zevv.nl/play/code/zevv-peep/

Traced using these instructions:

After tracing, I needed to do a uniform transform to 10% based around the glyph origin, then a y move -180 to land the characters in the correct position.
